          <h2>"Explore together"</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed
            to making science accessible to all.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Over the course of human history, science has developed from our
            early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
            everything from
          </p>
          <p>
            galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself. The
            aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience
            the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong
            passion to continue the exploration of the world around us. We
            believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought
            to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
            exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of
            these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around
            to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they
            only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
